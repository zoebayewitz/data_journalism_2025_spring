## Introduction

Consider this a personal guide to the commands and functions you will learn. In general, when you come across an R command or function that you want to remember, put it in here along with a description of what it does and when you'd use it.

### How to set the working directory

The command to set a working directory is setwd(). For example, this sets the working directory to a directory called data_journalism_2024_fall inside a directory called jour472 located inside your home directory (the ~ is equivalent of /Users/[youruser] on a Mac).

```{r}
setwd("~/jour472/data_journalism_2024_fall")
```

### How to install and load the tidyverse

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```
